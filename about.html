						<h1>About GDYLC</h1>
					</header>
					
					<p>The inaugural edition of the Hwa Chong - Global Digital Young Leaders Convention aims to be a unique platform for delegates from all corners of the world to conference and collaborate. Delegates can look forward to a 7 day conference where they immerse themselves in an alternate reality, responding to a pandemic where they take on roles of various stakeholders in the crisis and work together despite seemingly conflicting interests to overcome the various challenging problems embedded in the crisis, engaging in fruitful discussion and collaboration to resolve the crisis together. </p>

					<p>Given its fully digital nature, the organising team of the convention wishes for delegates to challenge the boundaries of global conventions and technology, to engage in open and transparent discussions. Through the convention, we sincerely hope delegates are not only able to develop global competencies such as problem solving and collaboration, but also widen their perspectives, understanding how different stakeholders are affected in a crisis  and the complexities of society in a macro and micro level beyond what is taught in the confines of the classroom. Lastly, we hope that delegates can apply their knowledge and experience in their lives and take concrete action to make a positive impact on their society.</p>

					<p>We wish all delegates a pleasant and meaningful experience during the Hwa Chong - Global Digital Young Leaders Convention. More importantly, stay safe, and stay healthy.</p>
