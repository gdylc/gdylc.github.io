					<p>The logo of the Hwa Chong Global Digital Young Leaders’ Convention (HC-GDYLC) explores the concept of identity in our VUCA world. GDYLC takes on a bold yet ever-relevant ideology of using technology to dimensionally reimagine the way we connect with one another, a vision that is represented succinctly using the motif of the thumbprint in the logo.</p>
 
					<p>A thumbprint is a felicitous emblem of biometrics - today, it is a common digital tool to ensure our safety and security, a testament to an elegant coalescence between our modern mastery of technology and our longstanding, fundamental human biology. Framing the silhouettes of Earth’s continents, the thumbprint is also a commanding symbol of our shared identity - as global citizens, it is necessary for us to navigate our shared adversities together. The red core of the thumbprint, besides representing Singapore as ‘the Little Red Dot’, highlights the position of all delegates as global citizens - the centre of a vast, international identity, with roots no longer bound in traditional geography. Our boundaries have, with the emergence of technology, dissolved to give rise to new alliances and new fault lines in the world today. Our humanity is no longer defined by our continents and seas, but instead by the new, abstract identities and perspectives we can create and the changes and impact that we choose to make together. Consequently, a global identity defines our future - and technology is already present, a ready platform through which we can chart our paths. These are precisely the grounds that the novel convention format of GDYLC was born - in adversity and diversity, and humanity needs to find its footing with a new identity in concord.</p>
 
					<p>The thumbprint has now become the new passport to the world for our young global leaders. Let us stand in solidarity, charter a new era and aim to leave a lasting imprint in our respective nations and beyond.</p>
