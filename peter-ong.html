            <br>
            <span style="text-align: justify">The Chinese word for “crisis” is a combination of two logogram signifying “danger” and “opportunity”. Amid the <br>worriment the COVID-19 pandemic has brought, opportunities for enterprises to reinvent themselves and emerge <br> stronger have also surfaced. Thriving in this uncertain landscape also calls for an open mind and continuous upskilling. This keynote seeks to outline a direction for enterprises moving forward, delve into the opportunities that such organisations should capitalise on, as well as highlight what young talents can do to prepare for the future.
