			<p style="text-align: justify">Greetings to all delegates! Welcome to the inaugural edition of the Hwa Chong Global Digital Young Leaders Convention. This pioneering convention provides a novel platform for aspiring young leaders from around the globe to conference digitally, and immerse in an online environment during a global crisis and represent the collective spirit of our global youths to resolve the issues confronting them. Even in these trying times, it is imperative that we remain forward-looking in harnessing the potential of technology to transcend our geographical barriers. The importance of providing a collective platform for students internationally to build trust and friendship through cross-cultural discourse cannot be understated.</p>

			<p style="text-align: justify">This year’s theme – ‘Concord: Standing in Solidarity, Chartering a New Era’ is highly apt for the exigent crisis we are in now, and particularly pertinent for the leaders of tomorrow. The unexpected global pandemic has struck us at a time when societies ride the waves of globalisation. Clouded by fear and often influenced by the deluge of misinformation, our collective aspirations for greater integration and connectivity are facing increasing challenges. The current Covid-19 pandemic will only be one of the many crises youths will be experiencing in their lives. Our approach towards dealing with this crisis as one will soon become testament to our grit as a global community.   </p>

			<p style="text-align: justify">Still, there is ample reason to be optimistic. An increasing number of young leaders are taking the lead in shaping policies in accordance with the world’s changing priorities. In addition, we witness a new generation of inspiring youth change-makers, playing an increasingly vital role in spurring change around the world, each making a positive difference to his or her community.</p>

			<p style="text-align: justify">The logo of HC-GDYLC, a thumbprint framing the silhouettes of Earth’s continents is therein a commanding symbol of our shared identity – as global citizens, it is crucial for us to navigate our shared adversities together. The new decade brings with it unprecedented challenges. As future leaders, be sure to stay grounded and put yourselves in the shoes of different stakeholders in the global community. Take on the mantle to explore novel solutions. In this new decade, we must tap on our global partnerships to stand in solidarity, while upholding the universal truths of peace, justice and equality.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify">The very inception of HC-GDYLC, in essence, is an exemplification of how we attempt to transform challenges into opportunities and charter a new era. Education is no longer about solely preparing our students to excel in tests with flying colours. It is about developing global competencies and character strengths, creating a model of empowerment to fortify meaningful action in society. Importantly, it is also about inculcating enduring values and a respectful mind that embraces difference and celebrates diversity. The Covid-19 crisis has taught us that we will be much better off when we set aside differences, share data and resources in an open and transparent manner and bring together our strengths and collective wisdom residing in each community.</p>
            
            <p style="text-align: justify">In this regard, it is my hope that from this enriching experience, you will forge new and long-lasting friendships that translate into enduring commitments to stand in solidarity in the years ahead.</p>
            
            <p style="text-align: justify">I wish all of our international friends a wonderful time, and to all delegates, an inspiring and enriching convention! Stay safe, and stay healthy!</p>

            <p>Mr Pang Choon How<br>
                Principal <br>
                Hwa Chong Institution
