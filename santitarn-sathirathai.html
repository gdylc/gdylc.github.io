                At Sea, he heads the company’s Research and Public Policy Unit and leads Sea’s engagement with policymakers and thought leaders around the region, with a particular focus on promoting digital skills and literacy for young people, SMEs, and other industry stakeholders.

                A passionate advocate for the power of technology to drive transformation and inclusion, he published his first book, Futuration, in Thailand in 2019.
