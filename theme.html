				<h1>CONCORD:</br>STANDING IN SOLIDARITY,<br>CHARTERING A NEW ERA</h1>
			</header>
			<p style="text-align: justify">
				The theme for the inaugural Hwa Chong Global Digital Young Leaders Convention (HC-GDYLC) is Concord:
				Standing in
				Solidarity, Chartering a New Era. Just as musical notes in concord come together to form a distinct
				harmony, a dynamic
				mix of people come forth during HC-GDYLC to reimagine our world, assembling individual perspectives into
				a powerful and
				inspiring global mosaic — all while transcending the physical barriers of geography and time zones.
			</p>
			<p style="text-align: justify">
				In times of global adversity — not just the oft-cited COVID-19 health crisis, but even long-standing
				issues like
				terrorism, trade conflict and climate change — insular ideologies will only prove to be to our
				detriment. The world is
				in a precarious position: clouded by fear and often influenced by the deluge of misinformation, the
				propensity for
				blaming an outgroup instead of mitigating the real problem is very high. Leaders of some countries fail
				to realise that
				our interconnectedness means that the problem of one group will invariably become a global issue as
				well. In order to
				minimise the global impact of a crisis, all countries need to realise that synergistic cooperation is
				key to effective
				problem-solving, rather than the blame game.
			</p>
			<p style="text-align: justify">

				However, all hope is not lost. The current situation is certainly less bleak than it seems, with many
				standing in
				solidarity to confront the problems plaguing the world today, all whilst reinventing the necessary
				methods seeming to
				belong to a bygone era. An increasing number of progressive young leaders are taking over the political
				helm, shaping
				policies in accordance with the world’s changing priorities. The world’s youngest Prime Minister, Sanna
				Marin of
				Finland, has recently shed new light on climate reform, pioneering the idea of how the fight against
				climate change need
				not be a burden, but can instead be transformed into a budding economic opportunity. With fresh-faced
				leaders
				establishing their revolutionary visions for the next decade, it ignites the confidence that we are
				capable of forging
				the best way forward.
			</p>
			<p style="text-align: justify">

				In response to a less top-down approach to governance, those on the ground need to harness the benefits
				of a more
				transparent and open democracy by bringing their ideas to the forefront. With nations governed by
				experienced
				politicians with decades of experience, comes a challenge: conformity to existing ideologies and the
				inevitable inertia
				in enacting systemic change. The new generation of inspiring youth activists plays an increasingly vital
				role in
				spurring change in unison around the world. "I want you to act like your house is on fire, because it
				is." said Greta
				Thunberg at the World Economic Forum last year. The 17 year old face of the environmentalist movement
				has spearheaded
				climate strikes of unprecedented scale, uniting millions of youth to demand bold climate action from
				political leaders.
				The voices of youth have incontrovertibly been amplified, and their concerns have been heard as they
				helm global
				movements that command the world’s attention.
			</p>
			<p style="text-align: justify">

				On the surface, youth activism promises a deviation from the conformist ideologies of politics and a
				passion for
				implementing changes that may very well disrupt the intricate process of governance. Are we ready for a
				series of
				changes that may intrude upon the peace and stability we currently enjoy? How effective has youth
				activism been in
				translating thought into concrete political action from the authorities? Despite the ascendancy of
				environmentalism,
				COP25 concluded in disappointment as conflicting nations failed to agree on many intended outcomes, such
				as rules to set
				up a global carbon trading system. In attempting to resolve any crisis which lies ahead, promises must
				transcend
				rhetoric and actualise through tangible goals in order to truly engender positive changes.
			</p>
			<p style="text-align: justify">

				The struggle between pursuing economic growth or committing ourselves to fulfilling the buzzword of
				‘global
				sustainability’ appears to be yet another unsolvable quandary. Yet, the unexpected crisis of COVID-19
				seems to have
				given us the perfect answer to this paradoxical argument. When a crisis strikes, those on the bottom
				rungs of the
				economic ladder are often hit the hardest, triggering a chain reaction that comes at the high cost of
				our economic
				health. Numbers indicative of absolute growth can no longer justify the fact that our economic system is
				built on
				increasingly shaky foundations that will collapse if threatened. 80% of the world’s energy used for
				economic development
				still overwhelmingly relies on burning fossil fuels - the main perpetrator of global warming, which
				could very well
				escalate into the next crisis after this pandemic. Societies can find a way out of archaic economic
				strategies by means
				of expanding green industries and adopting responsible production practices. Low-skilled workers can no
				longer be the
				main outlet of productivity in our industry, instead, innovation and upskilling is key to revitalising
				our economy.
				While this may come at a financial cost initially, such investments have significant pay-offs in the
				long-run.
			</p>
			<p style="text-align: justify">

				Education is another frontier in the long road towards sustainability. Through the COVID-19 crisis, an
				alarming
				faultline in our societies has been revealed: The Digital Divide. In our increasingly digital and
				interconnected world,
				failure to possess technology with access to the Internet has never been so consequential. The uneven
				distribution in
				the access to, use of, or impact of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) has highlighted the
				gulf between
				the privileged and the underprivileged, hindering the growth and development opportunities of those who
				lack access. In
				efforts to increase the accessibility of education worldwide, increasing partnerships and collaboration
				could hold the
				key to the problem, especially in developing countries. In Kenya, the Information Communication and
				Technology Trust
				Fund was set up to mobilise and channel ICT resources to Kenyan educational institutions. Funded by
				private sector
				partners including Microsoft, it was implemented with the coordination of the government, as well as
				members of the
				public, helping to greatly increase the accessibility of education to children across the nation.
				Providing more
				children with education is to provide not just these children, but their families a path to break out of
				the vicious
				cycle of poverty as they grow up educated with the competencies to work in better-paying skills-based
				jobs.
			</p>
			<p style="text-align: justify">

				Post COVID-19, the face of societies will change. Education will no longer be about preparing students
				to take tests set
				by bureaucrats who are not fully aware of the complexities of society. By involving businesses who
				better understand the
				working world, we can empower and enable students to be more prepared for the uncertain future. The
				future is now. It is
				of the essence that numerous stakeholders are involved in providing education to ensure wider
				perspectives are
				considered to create more rounded curricula that better prepare future generations of the world for the
				journey ahead.
				<a target="_blank" href="https://www.oecd.org/pisa/pisa-2018-global-competence.htm#:~:text=Global%20competence%20is%20the%20capacity,well%2Dbeing%20and%20sustainable%20development">The Programme for International Student Assessment's (PISA) 2018 Global Competencies framework</a>
				is an apt example of the skills that members of society need in order to adapt and thrive in our rapidly
				changing society.
			</p>
			<p style="text-align: justify">

				The new decade brings the promise of actualising lofty ambitions, but we must ensure that these goals
				are carried out
				with sufficient follow-through. The time is now for us youths to put ourselves in the shoes of key
				stakeholders, taking
				on the mantle to explore novel solutions and create robust systems. In this new decade, we must tap on
				our global
				partnerships to stand in solidarity, while upholding the universal truths of peace, justice and equality
				in order to
				take the next step forward to achieve sustainable development and progress towards fulfilling the 
				<a target="_blank" href="https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/?menu=1300">United
				Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDG)</a> to create a better society for all.
